# Arduino Ultrasonic

The ultrasonic sensor uses sonar to determine the distance of an object just like the bats do. It offers excellent non-contact range detection with high accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package from 2 cm to 400 cm or even more depending on the sensor model.

Arduino used: Arduino UNO
Sensor model: HC-SR04
